<h2>My 8-bit ALU has several main functions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Operand inversion</li>
  <li>AND, OR bitwise</li>
  <li>Shift, rotate bits</li>
  <li>Addition and subtraction</li>
  <li>Setting zero</li>
  <li>Return flags</li>
</ul>
<h2>In addtion, I designed adder based on Carry-lookahead technique to exploit parallel processing on operands.</h2>
